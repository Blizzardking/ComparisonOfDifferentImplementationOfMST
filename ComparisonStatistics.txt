Note: 
All the results above are obtained based on Windows 7 platform. 
For small test file, it seems Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm Implementation 2(Using BinaryHeap) have better performance than the other two. It could be attributed to the simpleness of the code used to implement Kruskal's algorithm.

However, for big test file, we can see that the order of running time of different implementations is: 

Prim's algorithm Implementation 2(Using BinaryHeap) <  Prim's algorithm Implementation 2(Using PairingHeap) < Prim's algorithm Implementation 1  < Kruskal's algorithm

To conclude, the winner of this test is Prim's algorithm Implementation 2(Using BinaryHeap with array recording indices)
